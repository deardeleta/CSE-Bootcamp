    <h3> New York City was once on local timeâ€”until the railroads changed everything!</h3>
    <p>Before time zones were established, every city kept its own local solar time, meaning noon was when the sun was directly overhead. That made scheduling trains a nightmare. So in 1883, U.S. and Canadian railroads adopted standardized time zones, and NYC officially switched from "New York Local Time" to Eastern Standard Time. The city's clocks were reset by about 3 minutes and 58 seconds!</p>
